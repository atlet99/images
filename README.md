# Custom Docker Images for Ansible, Kaniko, and Deployer

This repository contains Dockerfiles for building custom Docker images tailored for DevOps tools such as Ansible, Kaniko, and a deployer image with Terraform and other deployment utilities. These images are crafted to streamline automation and deployment workflows while ensuring consistency and security across various environments.

## Overview

The Dockerfiles included in this project allow you to build custom images for various DevOps tools:

* ***Ansible Image:*** a containerized environment for running Ansible;
* ***Kaniko Image:*** a container for building Docker images without requiring a Docker daemon;
* ***Deployer Image:*** a deployment-focused image containing Terraform, Helm, SOPS, and Kubernetes CLI tools.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Docker with buildx support is installed on your system. Follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) if buildx isnâ€™t enabled by default. Also you can setting up shell completion for Docker CLI via [Docker Completion Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/completion/).

### Building Images with buildx

To use `buildx` for building these images, create a builder instance if necessary:
```bash
docker buildx create --use
```
You can now build each image with appropriate build arguments:
```bash
# Build Ansible image
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg ANSIBLE_CORE_VERSION=2.16.4 \
  --build-arg ANSIBLE_VERSION=9.2.0 \
  --build-arg ANSIBLE_LINT=6.22.2 \
  -t ansible:stable \
  -f ansible.Dockerfile \
  --push .

# Build Kaniko image
docker buildx build \
  -t kaniko:stable \
  -f kaniko.Dockerfile \
  --push .

# Build Deployer image
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg HELMFILE_VERSION=0.147.0 \
  --build-arg HELM_VERSION=3.12.0 \
  --build-arg SOPS_VERSION=3.7.3 \
  --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=1.26.3 \
  --build-arg TERRAFORM_VERSION=1.5.3 \
  --build-arg HELMSMAN_APP_VERSION=3.17.0 \
  -t deployer:stable \
  -f deployer.Dockerfile \
  --push .
```
